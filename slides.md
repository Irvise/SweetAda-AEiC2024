# Objectives
SweetAda brings a lot to the table, we will showcase the following topics

- Present SweetAda
  - What it is
  - What it supports
  - How to work with it

- Showcase SweetAda
  - SweetAda on an FPGA
  - SweetAda on...

# Why SweetAda?
<span></span>

It started from a firmware for a small M68k embedded board...

<v-click>

### An idea... run Ada <span v-mark="{ type: 'underline', color: 'red', at: '2'}">everywhere</span>, when the CPU starts

</v-click>

<br>

<v-click at="3">

### Issues started to appear

- Toolchain? 
- RTS (Run Time System)?
- Build system/framework?

</v-click>

<br>

<v-click at="4">

### Goal

It should be capable of running even on an S/390 mainframe! Emulated at least
</v-click>

<!--
Maybe we could add a photo here of the M68k board to make this slide cooler

# A few extra goodies

### Build your own toolchain

```
~$ ls SweetAda/toolchains
Binutils.sh  GCC.sh  GDB.sh  GNATTOOLS.sh  linux-python-config.sh  MANUAL.txt
```

Scripts to build GCC/GNAT for all of these targets, though it is not fully automated

<v-click>

### It's own small C-lib

```
~$ ls SweetAda/clibrary
ada_interface.h  clibrary.gpr      ctype.c         c_wrappers.ads  gnat.adc  stdio.h   string.c   strings.h
assert.c         clibrary.h        ctype.h         errno.c         Makefile  stdlib.c  string.h
assert.h         configuration.in  c_wrappers.adb  errno.h         stdio.c   stdlib.h  strings.c
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

### A few drivers...

```
~$ ls SweetAda/drivers
am7990.adb        etherlinkiii.ads  ide.ads        pc.adb      piix.adb   uart16x50.adb  xps.ads

# SweetAda's technical stack
How to make all this possible

### GCC/GNAT compiler, the driving force

Needs no introduction nor explanation. GCC with all the architectures it supports, is the central pillar

<v-click>

### Good old `make`

Used as the skeleton for the build. It selects targets, runtimes, toolchains, flags, autogenerates/processes files, prints diagnostics... **But it does not do the compilation!**

</v-click>

<v-click>

### GPRBuild, the Ada heavyweight builder

Runs the build for the final binary/kernel

</v-click>

<v-click>

### And some configuration files

Each platform works a bit differently. A config file is present to help with the build config, post-build and upload

</v-click>

# A tipical workflow, step by step, using SweetAda

## First things first, get SweetAda & find help

# SweetAda's strengths
SweetAda offers a lot to the Ada (and wider) programming community

<v-clicks>

- üì§ **Portability** - run Ada code on a large number of architectures, boards and emulators!

- üßë‚Äçüíª **Developer friendly & Hackable** - show expand, tweak, improve and automate things as your needs evolve!
- üöÑ **Fast & easy work** - prepare, build and upload applications with just a few commands!
- üåï **Full support** - supports and builds several runtimes, with exceptions, interrupts, and much more!
- üöÄ **Open development** - has had tremendous growth and contributions are more than welcome!
- üìñ **MIT licensed** - hack, develop, integrate it however you like thanks to its liberal license!

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

### Future work?

Improve the RTS, more drivers, quality-of-life improvements, board support...
